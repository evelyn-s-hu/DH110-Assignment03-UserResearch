# Contextual Inquiry for the Washington State Department of Ecology Website
**Author:** Evelyn Hu  
**Course:** DH110 User Interface and Design  
**Description:** A comprehensive contextual inquiry conducted to identify points of improvement for the Washington State Department of Ecology website. An appropriate research method has been specified and consequently conducted with a participant in order to gain insight on areas of improvement.

## Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**  
**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)**  
**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**  
**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**  


## Step 2: Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**   
**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?**   
**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**   

## Step 3: Pick Research Methods
To better understand potential users, I chose to conduct a contextual inquiry. This was done over Zoom, with the participant sharing their screen so observations could be made.  
  
**Methods**  
- **Background questions**: In order to better understand my participant, some background questions were asked to gauge their prior experience with the topic at hand.
- **Observation**: I had my participant search some topics related to environmental issues and volunteering opportunities for environmental programs. While they did so, I observed their actions, and asked questions to better understand why they did what they did.
- **Follow-up questions**: After completion of the activities, I asked directive questions to better understand the participant's motivations and thought processes.

### Insights from the interview
1. In terms of approaching the environment, the user prefers little changes in their every day life that build up to make a difference.
> "I like stuff in my daily life, like, some habits that you can do every day. I can help [by making] sustainable swaps, that kind of thing."
> "Sustainability is kind of like most doable action because I think that kind of leads into the most pressing issues like global warming, and sustainability is kind of the solution to that. [I can] actually research how to be sustainable instead of how to stop global warming because you know, like sustainability, that's when you can actually learn about how to [make a difference]."
2. There is a subtle sense of nihilism when it comes to approaching how to assist environmental issues.
> "The environment is a pretty overwhelming thing. Like my friend who is good at environmental issues is just like, 'Hey, you know, it's like, too late to do anything.' I'm like, 'Okay, but the small steps like kind of help.' [...] Like, no one can ever dedicate a a full year just towards [environmental issues]."

## Step 6: Reflection
This field study was beneficial in better understanding how users may view the environment. A particularly useful insight I received was that the environment, as massive as it is and with as many issues as it has, can be very overwhelming to just one person. A lot of people may feel helpless when it comes to the environment and its many issues, and not without reason - this is definitely not something that can be solved by one person, or in one day. However, it was good to know that my participant liked to break down this problem into little things that she could do in her every day life so that she wouldn't be overwhelmed by such a daunting task. This insight will be particularly useful when it comes to redesigning the content of the Washington State Ecology website, as I have been reminded that it is important to take into consideration the user's feelings as they navigate this information. 
Prior to conducting the contextual inquiry, I was rather lost about how I should approach it given my goal of improving the Washington State Department of Ecology website. In the end, I settled on something that is tangentally related; as the environment is a big thing that affects many people, I thought that I should research how users think of it and how they may want to benefit the environment.  
If I were to do this contextual inquiry again, I would likely conduct it in person instead of over Zoom, as there were some connection issues that caused my participant's audio to cut out and lag at certain times. In addition, seeing the user's face and expressions as they do the activities I provided would likely help me gain a better understanding about their experience.
