# Contextual Inquiry for the Washington State Department of Ecology Website
**Author:** Evelyn Hu  
**Course:** DH110 User Interface and Design  
**Description:** A comprehensive contextual inquiry conducted to identify points of improvement for the Washington State Department of Ecology website. An appropriate research method has been specified and consequently conducted with a participant in order to gain insight on areas of improvement.

## Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**  
The purpose of this project was mainly to gauge public response to the environment, its issues, and ways to help prevent or slow down environmental issues. With this project, I hoped to better understand how people view (and with what emotions) environmental issues, and what motivations they would need to prompt them to help out with such issues. I also wanted to understand how people view environmental issues in the context of other social issues.  
**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**  
This activity fulfills both the safety and social belonging needs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the safety hierarchy involves natural disaster and other aspects that affect human lives, the wellbeing of the environment would fall under this category. Additionally, as environmental issues can be categorized under social issues, as well as the fact that it requires teamwork to make a difference, I would classify this activity as falling under the social belonging category as well.  
**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**  
There are multiple solutions to work towards satisfying the problem of environmental issues, though I would argue that it is nigh impossible to truly satisfy the needs or solve environmental issues at this stage of its severity. Regardless, one way for users to make a difference is through their own every day actions and being mindful about their carbon footprint; for example, using reusable items instead of disposables such as water bottles, utensils, cloths instead of napkins, etc. Another way for users to make a difference is through group efforts, such as getting involved with organizations or volunteering to benefit the environment.  
**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**  
Accessibility to resources and opportunities for volunteering would definitely be improved with digitization, as information would be more accessible to more people. As environmental issues have a lot of depth to them, educating yourself on how to make a difference is an important step when it comes to taking care of the environment; with digitization, all of this information will likely become more accessible.    

## Step 2: Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users?**  
As *everyone* lives in and interacts with the environment, the demographic would correspondingly be very broad as well, as it would benefit everyone to gain access to resources regarding the environment. From young to old, novice to expert, non-experienced to experienced, everyone should aim to educate themselves on how to make a difference starting with little steps. Therefore, the website should aim to cater to a wide demographic of users.    
**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?**   
Users will generally seek out information regarding the environment following a big news headline, like a wildfire or oil spill in order to gain better understanding about it. Users may seek out volunteering opportunities when the need arises; for example, high schoolers may be required to volunteer before graduation. Additionally, as more and more sustainability programs are being instilled throughout every day life (like UCLA's zero waste policy, for example), users may be prompted to research sustainability methods, such as how to properly sort trash.  
**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**   
Users would generally search up a relevant search term in their search engine of choice and click the first couple options that pop up, due to ease of accessibility and convenience. Users will be deterred from further interacting with a webpage if they are met with a wall of text upon opening the link; websites must be eye-catching in order to retain interest.  

## Step 3: Pick Research Methods
To better understand potential users, I chose to conduct a contextual inquiry. This was done over Zoom, with the participant sharing their screen so observations could be made.  
  
**Methods**  
- **Background questions**: In order to better understand my participant, some background questions were asked to gauge their prior experience with the topic at hand.
- **Observation**: I had my participant search some topics related to environmental issues and volunteering opportunities for environmental programs. While they did so, I observed their actions, and asked questions to better understand why they did what they did.
- **Follow-up questions**: After completion of the activities, I asked directive questions to better understand the participant's motivations and thought processes.

### Insights from the interview
1. In terms of approaching the environment, the user prefers little changes in their every day life that build up to make a difference.
> "I like stuff in my daily life, like, some habits that you can do every day. I can help [by making] sustainable swaps, that kind of thing."
> "Sustainability is kind of like most doable action because I think that kind of leads into the most pressing issues like global warming, and sustainability is kind of the solution to that. [I can] actually research how to be sustainable instead of how to stop global warming because you know, like sustainability, that's when you can actually learn about how to [make a difference]."
2. There is a subtle sense of nihilism when it comes to approaching how to assist environmental issues.
> "The environment is a pretty overwhelming thing. Like my friend who is good at environmental issues is just like, 'Hey, you know, it's like, too late to do anything.' I'm like, 'Okay, but the small steps like kind of help.' [...] Like, no one can ever dedicate a a full year just towards [environmental issues]."

## Step 6: Reflection
This field study was beneficial in better understanding how users may view the environment. A particularly useful insight I received was that the environment, as massive as it is and with as many issues as it has, can be very overwhelming to just one person. A lot of people may feel helpless when it comes to the environment and its many issues, and not without reason - this is definitely not something that can be solved by one person, or in one day. However, it was good to know that my participant liked to break down this problem into little things that she could do in her every day life so that she wouldn't be overwhelmed by such a daunting task. This insight will be particularly useful when it comes to redesigning the content of the Washington State Ecology website, as I have been reminded that it is important to take into consideration the user's feelings as they navigate this information. 
Prior to conducting the contextual inquiry, I was rather lost about how I should approach it given my goal of improving the Washington State Department of Ecology website. In the end, I settled on something that is tangentally related; as the environment is a big thing that affects many people, I thought that I should research how users think of it and how they may want to benefit the environment.  
If I were to do this contextual inquiry again, I would likely conduct it in person instead of over Zoom, as there were some connection issues that caused my participant's audio to cut out and lag at certain times. In addition, seeing the user's face and expressions as they do the activities I provided would likely help me gain a better understanding about their experience.
